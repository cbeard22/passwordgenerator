# Password Generator


# Purpose 
This assignment was to create a random password generator that would allow the user to select which characters they would like to include in their password. The password needs to be between 8 and 128 characters and the user gets to select their preference with a window prompt. They then can decide whether they would like uppercase letters, lowercase letter, numbers, or special characters included in their password. When the user clicks the generate button the prompt windows should start and if they make atleast one character choice and a length between 8 and 128 the password will generate. Otherwise, it will start over. 

# Usage
